#  I. Overview 

   The core principle of using PCL segmentation to extract multiple spheres is still RANSAC fitting spherical surfaces. Here is just a simple modification, which is suitable for extracting multiple spheres. For the specific implementation principle, see: PCL RANSAC fitting spatial 3D spheres.
