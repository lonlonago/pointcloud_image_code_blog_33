#  I. Overview 

   The core principle of using PCL segmentation to extract multiple cylinders is still RANSAC fitting cylinders. Here is just a simple modification, which is suitable for extracting multiple cylinders. For the specific implementation principle, see: PCL RANSAC fitting segmentation cylinder model.
